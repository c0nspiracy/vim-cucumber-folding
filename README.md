vim-cucumber-folding
====================

Folding pattern for Cucumber features.  It will add fold markers at `Background` and `Scenario` lines, making it easy to navigate larger cucumber feature files.

# Installation

I recommend using [vundle](https://github.com/gmarik/vundle) to install:

```
Bundle 'greggroth/vim-cucumber-folding'
```
